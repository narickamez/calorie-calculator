# calorie-calculator
Today I will use python to show you how you can calculate exactly how many calories you need each day depending on a variety of inputs, such as age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. 

I made a calorie calculator so you never have to worry about how many calories you need to eat everyday to maintain your current body weight. Later versions of this code will include how many calories you would need to eat to reach your goals, such as gaining/losing 2 pounds per week. This can be calculated by adding/subtracting 1000 calories to/from your current daily requirement.
